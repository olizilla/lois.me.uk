      <p>L O I S started out in 2013 as a small, independent bricks and mortar shop in Peckham selling a range of products made exclusively in the UK by independent designer-makers. From a desire to be more actively involved in the creative process behind the products we sold and the stories behind those products, we closed the Peckham shop and relaunched in 2015 as an online shop and creative resource.</p>
      <p>L O I S online was the next step in our creative journey. Through collaborations with a limited number of London-based designers, we created a unique range of products available only through us. Every item was carefully thought out from concept to production, harnessing and highlighting the specific skills and creative experience of the designers involved, each of whom have their own individual style and techniques.</p>
      <p>With the online shop taking a sabbatical, L O I S now aims to show you the processes and people behind the scenes. To this end, we have dedicated profiles for each designer we collaborated with - you can watch films of them working on products, read their stories and get to know the people who make the things you buy. We've also started a blog, a place we hope will provide a further insight into the lives of makers and their incredible skills.</p>
