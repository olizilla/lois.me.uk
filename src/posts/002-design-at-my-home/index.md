One of the reasons I wanted to start the L O I S blog was to show off the awesome creative talent behind some of the brands and designs I enjoy looking at. The subconscious tagline was always intended to be 'for people who like stuff that looks good'. But I also believe that there is creativity, inspiration and things that 'look good' in the every day things we see and especially, in the collections of things gathered together by people in their homes and places of work.

With that in mind, I've decided to start a hopefully regular feature focusing on the things I see and like the look of in the various places I go. There's no agenda to it, just pictures to enjoy looking at.

First up: my home.
