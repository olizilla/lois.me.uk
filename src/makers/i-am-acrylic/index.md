When they’re not keeping warm on their stall at Old Spitalfields Market, you’ll most likely find Brendan and Ruth - fretsaw whisperers behind i am acrylic - working in their studio or spying on the blue tit who hangs out just outside their window. Either that, or completing a complicated jigsaw puzzle.

I say fretsaw whisperers because everything made by i am acrylic is created using a fretsaw, and then finished by hand. There’s no laser cutting involved, just a big scary mechanical saw and some very brave and talented fingers.

I really enjoyed collaborating with Brendan and Ruth on an exclusive coastal print design that was printed by Peckham Print Studio. Its simplicity made it very pleasing to look at, and it acted as the inspiration for an exclusive - and totally awesome - brooch and necklace set.
