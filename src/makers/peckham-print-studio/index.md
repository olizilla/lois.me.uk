Only a few years old and Peckham Print Studio (PPS) has already become a staple within the London art scene. As well as offering open access screen printing facilities for their members, PPS also run workshops at the weekends and fulfil a wide variety of commercial printing jobs, from fine art canvases to branded t-shirts.

The guys behind PPS are some of the friendliest I’ve ever met. Referred to variously as ‘the lads’ and ‘the boys’, Nathan, Hugh and Tom have created a professional printing studio that maintains both a strong sense of personality, and the ability to make lay-printers feel at ease.

They’re just really enthusiastic about what they do, and that’s something that comes across in their work. And they’re big tea drinkers which always goes down well in my book. Just make sure you bring biscuits.
